DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains the source code and supporting documentation for OptList,
an ANSI C command line option parser library.

OptList is released under the GNU LGPL version 3.0.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc:
1. Windows users should define the environment variable OS to be Windows or
   Windows_NT.  This is often already done.
2. Enter the command "make" from the command line.

USAGE
-----
The file sample.c demonstrates the usage of OptList.

SYNOPSIS
typedef struct option_t
{
    char option;
    char *argument;
    int argIndex;
    struct option_t *next;
} option_t;

option_t *GetOptList(int argc, char *const argv[], char *const options);


DESCRIPTION
The GetOptList() function is similar to getopt().  Its most notable differences
are that it returns a linked list to the command line arguments and their
parameters.  One call to GetOptList() will return all of the command line
options and their arguments.  GetOptList() will not modify argc or argv.

GetOptList()'s parameters "argc" and "argv" are the argument count and array as
passed to the main() function on program invocation.  An element of argv that
starts with "-" is an option element.  The character following the "-" is option
an character.

The parameter "options" is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
If such a character is followed by a colon, the option requires an argument.
(e.g. "a:bc?" a, b ,c, and, ? are all options.  a should be followed by an
argument.)

GetOptList() returns a linked list of type option_t.  The "*next" field of the
element at the end of the list will be set to NULL.  The "option" field will
contain the option character.  A pointer to the following text in the same
argv-element, or the text of the following argv-element will be stored in the
"arguement" field, otherwise the "arguement" field is set to NULL.  The index
of the argv-element containing the argument will be stored in the "argIndex".
If there is no argument, the field will contain OL_NOINDEX.

HISTORY
-------
08/01/07  - Initial release
09/13/14  - Added FindFileName function, because I always use it with GetOptList
            Tighter adherence to Michael Barr's "Top 10 Bug-Killing Coding
            Standard Rules" (http://www.barrgroup.com/webinars/10rules).

TODO
----
- Add support for --option_name
